# Spaceship Titanic – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project explores the [Spaceship Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic/) using Python. The analysis focuses on data cleaning, feature engineering, and correlation analysis to uncover insights about passenger behavior.

## Project Objectives

- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Explore key variables and distributions  
- Analyze the data
- Visualize correlations and relationships  
- Prepare data for potential modeling

---

## Tools Used

- Python (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- GitHub

---

## Key Insights

- Passengers who opted for cryo-sleep tended to spend significantly less on services like food, VRDeck, and spa.  
- Strong correlation (r = 0.56) was found between `HomePlanet` and `Cabin`, indicating possible grouping based on origin.  
- Spending habits showed mild correlation across service categories, reflecting consistent behavior among certain passengers.  
- Age showed minimal correlation with ShoppingMall spending.
